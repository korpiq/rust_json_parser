This is abandonware since inception. I just wanted to learn rust and got interested in `nom`. It's neat but I gave up trying to stream files into it. Seems `serde` already does what I want, including initializing fields one by one as they are read from a stream.

Thanks to my employer [my employer](https://futurice.com) for [supporting](https://spiceprogram.org/) my learning. here.
